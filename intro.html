            Hello my name is Carlos Rangel. I am a student at Cal State San Bernardino majoring in Computer Engineer. 
            The page was made to present my projects, resume and work expericence that I have done through out the past years. 
            I majored in Computer Engineer beacuse since I was a kid I loved to try the newest technology and learn new ways of using that tech to improve my lifestyle. 
            Other than tech I like to keep my body healthy so I try to eat clean, lift weights and do at least 30 minutes of cardio to keep a healthy heart.        
            I go to the gym at least 4 times a weeks for 1 - 2 hours depending on my free time.
            I also like to travel I have been to some parts of the US and Mexico, my goal is to explore Latin America first and then visit Africa.
            In the future I would like to be a part of an innovation that can help many people around the world for example in education, envorimental, health etc... anything that can benefit the world.
